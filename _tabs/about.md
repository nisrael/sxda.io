Hi, I am Nils, a quirky but mostly harmless IT professional (he/him) with an interest in hiking, programming, analog synth, Catan, tinkering, puzzles and rogue li[kt]es who tries not to lose hope in humanity.

This page is mainly for my own reference, to keep track of things I've tried, learned or summarized from other sources and that I might need again. I'm grateful if someone else finds the notes and tips here helpful.
